# MusicCollector Project Plan

This plan outlines the phased development of the MusicCollector web application. The project will use a C# .NET backend, Next.js frontend, xUnit for unit testing, and Playwright for end-to-end testing. All code will follow Microsoft coding standards and SOLID principles. Each phase is independent and results in a working example.

---

## Phase 1: Project Skeleton & Initial Setup

- [ ] Create solution structure in the current folder
- [ ] Initialize C# .NET Web API backend (Microsoft coding style)
- [ ] Initialize Next.js frontend app
- [ ] Set up xUnit test project for backend
- [ ] Set up Playwright for frontend e2e tests
- [ ] Add README.md with build/run instructions
- [ ] Ensure backend and frontend can run locally (localhost)

---

## Phase 2: Basic Web Interface & API Connection

- [ ] Create a basic homepage in Next.js
- [ ] Implement a simple API endpoint in .NET backend (e.g., /api/health)
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API (fetch health status)
- [ ] Write xUnit test for API endpoint
- [ ] Write Playwright test for homepage and API connection

---

## Phase 3: Set Up PostgreSQL Database Integration

- [ ] Add PostgreSQL as the database for the project
- [ ] Configure .NET backend to connect to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Add connection string management (environment variables, secrets)
- [ ] Verify backend can connect to PostgreSQL instance
- [ ] Document setup steps for local development

---

## Phase 4: Prepare for Incremental Feature Development

- [ ] Set up modular structure for backend (services, models, controllers)
- [ ] Set up modular structure for frontend (components, pages, services)
- [ ] Document how to add new features and tests

---

## Notes
- This plan will be updated as new features are added.
- Each phase should result in a working, testable application.
- All tasks should be checked off as completed.
